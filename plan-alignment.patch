+# Trading Coach (AI Copilot) — Authoritative Roadmap
+**Status:** Authoritative. This document supersedes any older planning docs in this repo.
+
+> Source of truth for scope, sequencing, and decisions. Everything here takes precedence over existing code and older docs.
+
+## Vision
+An AI “Trading Coach” that generates deterministic, risk-aware trade plans with confidence scoring, MTF (multi-timeframe) analysis, ATR/EMA-based stops/targets, MFE-driven runner extensions, and weekend/offline planning logic. Plans support options (incl. LEAPS), historical/backtesting (Polygon/fixtures for tests; Massive for live), and clear, structured outputs.
+
+## Providers (Massive-first)
+- **Live data:** Massive.com (Options Advanced + Indices Advanced)
+- **Optional legacy:** Polygon **behind a feature flag** only (`FEATURE_POLYGON_ENABLED=false` by default)
+- **Closed/Mock:** Snapshots fallback + `FEATURE_MOCK_MODE` for test/staging
+
+## Product pillars
+1. **Deterministic trade plans** with structured schema (`trade_detail`, `idea_url`, options contracts, extra take-profits incl. “leave runners”).
+2. **Confluence engine** (MTF, ATR/EMA, probability-based TP scaling).
+3. **Weekend/offline planning** using historical data + snapshots fallback.
+4. **Confidence & rationale** surfaced to UI; Discord share.
+5. **Typed contracts everywhere** (zod) and **fail-fast envs**.
+
+---
+
+## Sprints (P0 → P2)
+
+### Sprint 0 (completed groundwork)
+- Railway backend is up; healthz and session endpoints verified.
+- Massive WS handshake + service state ok; local testing confirmed.
+- Frontend builds and deploys; CORS/WS origin alignment done.
+
+### Sprint 1 — Platform hardening (P0)
+**Goals:** Typed envs, Massive-first gating, WS controls, snapshots writer, alerts coverage, CI guards.
+
+**Scope**
+- **Typed env schema** (server+client) with fail-fast (zod) and `.env.example` refresh.
+- **Massive-first:** add `FEATURE_POLYGON_ENABLED` (default **false**), remove accidental Polygon paths when off.
+- **WS limits:** `WS_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`, `WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`, `WS_IDLE_CLOSE_MS`.
+- **Snapshots:** worker job to persist LKG (last-known-good) and read fallback when closed.
+- **Discord alerts:** session transitions, scanner health, rate/circuit events, and trade lifecycle.
+- **Security/DX:** `trust proxy`, request-id, log level; CI env guard + dep audit.
+
+**Done when**
+- Backend/worker boot fails on invalid env; Polygon never used when disabled.
+- WS obeys env limits; idle cleanup works; oversize payloads rejected.
+- `/api/snapshots?symbol=...` returns LKG in closed/premarket.
+- CI gates: lint, typecheck, tests, build; dep audit runs.
+
+### Sprint 2 — Strategy & plans (P0/P1)
+**Goals:** Wire strategy detector to produce deterministic plans and confidence.
+- Expand `StrategyDetector` to surface ATR/EMA stops/targets, MFE runners, and rationale.
+- REST+WS schema for plans; UI surfacing + Discord share.
+- RLS policies for new tables (setups/trades already in place); tests.
+
+### Sprint 3 — Backtesting & weekend planner (P1)
+**Goals:** Historical pipeline (offline/weekend) with fixtures + Massive backfill.
+- Weekend runner (worker) to compile weekly breakout candidates (swings/LEAPS).
+- Plan generator uses historical bars and snapshots; does not reduce confidence just because market is closed.
+- Backtest harness; confidence calibration.
+
+### Sprint 4 — Observability & polish (P1/P2)
+**Goals:** Dashboards, alerts, runbooks; performance polish.
+- RED/USE dashboards; alert rules for worker/backpressure/circuit.
+- Cache/batch REST; connection pooling; rate shaping.
+- Optional tracing (OTel).
+
+---
+
+## Architectural decisions (ADRs)
+1. **Massive-first** provider with optional Polygon via `FEATURE_POLYGON_ENABLED` (default off).
+2. **Snapshots fallback** required for closed/unstable provider windows.
+3. **Strict contracts** (zod) across WS/REST; typed envs; fail-fast.
+4. **Deterministic plans** with transparent rationale (confidence inputs visible).
+5. **Security:** RLS everywhere; admin key for sensitive paths; CORS/WS allow-list.
+
+---
+
+## Deliverables checklists
+- **Backend**
+  - `/api/market/status`, `/api/snapshots`, `/api/trades`, `/api/plans`
+  - WS: subscribe/unsubscribe; broadcast `ServerOutbound` types only
+  - Metrics: Prom + health/readiness
+- **Worker**
+  - Scan jobs per session mode; snapshot persistence; Discord signals
+- **Frontend**
+  - Status banners per session; Watchlist; Active Trades; Plan detail; Share to Discord
+  - Connection diagnostics; skeletons/empty/error states
+
+---
+
+## Environments (authoritative)
+- `MASSIVE_API_KEY`, `MASSIVE_BASE_URL`, `MASSIVE_WS_BASE`, `MASSIVE_WS_CLUSTER`
+- `FEATURE_ENABLE_MASSIVE_STREAM=true`
+- `FEATURE_POLYGON_ENABLED=false` (optional legacy)
+- `FEATURE_MOCK_MODE` (tests/staging)
+- `WS_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`, `WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`, `WS_IDLE_CLOSE_MS`
+- `CORS_ALLOWLIST`, `TRUST_PROXY`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `REQUEST_BODY_LIMIT`
+- `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
+- `DISCORD_ENABLED`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`, `DISCORD_*RETRY*`
+- Frontend: `VITE_BACKEND_URL`, `VITE_BACKEND_WS_URL`, `VITE_DEMO_USER_ID`
+
+---
+
+## Test & acceptance
+- ≥85% critical modules (env, ws handler, Massive client, trade/plan services)
+- Worker snapshot job/retries covered; Discord sender retried/JIT
+- WS env controls verified by tests (idle, payload cap)
+- RLS policy tests for snapshots/trades/plans
+
+---
+
+## Runbooks
+- Massive outage → use snapshots + mock mode (staging), alert, watch circuit gauge
+- Rate limit breach → batch/shape; reduce cadence; monitor 429 counters
+- Env drift → correct envs per `.env.example`
+
+---
+
+## Backlog
+- Full tracing (OTel), advanced backpressure strategies, broker abstraction for live orders (future)
